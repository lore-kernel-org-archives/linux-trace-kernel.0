bpf: keep the vmlinux BTF zstd-compressed in the kernel image

This commit adds CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF_LAZY to store the vmlinux BTF
zstd-compressed in the kernel image and decompress it on first access via
btf_vmlinux_data().

[Severity: Low]
This isn't a bug in the code, but the commit message still has an
unresolved TODO-NEEDS-IHOR prefix on the Signed-off-by trailer pairing with
Co-developed-by. Should this placeholder be resolved to a clean
Signed-off-by tag?

[Severity: Low]
This isn't a bug, but when updating this multi-line comment in btf_free()
in kernel/bpf/btf.c, could the opening /* be placed on its own line to
follow the BPF coding style?
