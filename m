I was thinking this change had to do with the splice callback for
trace_pipe_raw (which is a hot path that does zero copy of the ftrace ring
buffer into files). But looking at this further, I see that it's for just
the "trace" file, which is a textual conversion of the tracing data (slow
path, although some user space uses this and parses the text, which IMHO is
wrong).

In other words, I don't really care much about this code being "efficient".
