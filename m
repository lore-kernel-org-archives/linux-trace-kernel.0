This still looks over-engineered. I understand that in case of a single CMA

area using cma_alloc() is not enough for Your use-case, but You already

pointed that You need to have custom method of managing which part of memory

is assigned to secure world, so wouldn't it be much simpler just to add

cma_alloc_exact_range() -like function and keep using a single, boot-time

defined CMA area? Then in instead of creating and deleting CMA areas

dynamically, You just 'allocate' respective ranges from the single CMA area

and manage them on You own (like in current patchset).

That's okay.
