From: "Kiryl Shutsemau (Meta)" <kas@kernel.org>

A round takes mmap_lock for reading and holds it across the freeze, the
copy and the install.  It is a read lock, so it blocks no faults -- but
every writer to the address space waits behind it, wherever in the mm that
writer is working.

A round works inside one VMA.  Everything it has to be excluded from --
fork, split, merge, unmap, and the free_pgtables() that follows them --
takes vma_start_write() on the VMA it touches first.  So a read lock on
that VMA excludes exactly what an mmap_read excluded, and an mmap_write
elsewhere in the mm stops waiting for a collapse it has nothing to do
with.

Look the VMA up with lock_vma_under_rcu() per round.  The round therefore
no longer works on the VMA the scan was given: it may be a different one
at that address, or the same one shrunk.  collapse_revalidate() already
re-asks every question the scan asked, and now also checks that the VMA
still covers what the round collected.

That lookup also fails on a VMA that is merely being written to, because
vma_start_read() fails while a writer holds vma_start_write().  A caller
cannot tell that from a VMA that has gone, so report SCAN_VMA_LOCK for
both, which MADV_COLLAPSE turns into -EAGAIN.  Treating it as a range that
shrank would report success for a collapse that never happened.

The fault-in pass gives up the same lock it was called under, so its
unlocks move with it, and the comments that carry the exclusion argument
name the lock they argue from.
