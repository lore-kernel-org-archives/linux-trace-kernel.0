Subject: [PATCH v1 9/9] landlock: Fix tracepoint contract documentation

The tracepoint documentation claims that denial and lifecycle events
expose every input needed to reproduce a verdict. Instead document how
denial, ruleset, and domain events identify the denying policy, checked
operation and object, and reason for denial. Direct consumers to generic
tracepoints for additional operational context.

State the reconstruction limits: IDs are boot-local, rule checks have no
request ID, and exported records may be lost or cross-CPU reordered.

Also replace the incorrect BPF_RAW_TRACEPOINT guidance with libbpf
SEC("tp_btf/...") attachment and refer consumers to the event prototypes
for callback argument layouts.
