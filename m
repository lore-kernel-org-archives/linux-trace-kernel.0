Yeah, this currently relies on the circumstances being such that
can_set_direct_map() returns true, and in the case where we want to use
the resizable VPR functionality, we're going to have page-granular
mappings anyway.

This sounds intriguing. For VPR we could possibly make the size a
multiple of the memblock size (or whatever might be appropriate). If we
can create a page-granular linear mapping specifically for that region,
that'd be ideal. I don't know if the linear mapping can be subdivided in
this fashion, though.

Could this be simplified if this type of allocation is always memblock
aligned?

Looking at map_mem(), it seems like we could add some sort of special-
casing in the for_each_mem_range() block to check if the memory is VPR
(or generic, page-granular carveout, or whatever we want to call it) and
set NO_BLOCK_MAPPINGS | NO_CONT_MAPPINGS in that case.

If that works, set_direct_map_*() could be enhanced to detect such cases
and always work. Or perhaps a more specific API could be introduced.
