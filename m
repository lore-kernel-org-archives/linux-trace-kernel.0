We have powerful mechanisms in the stack already that ordinary (no
privilege requested) applications can readily use.

We have been using them for a while.

If existing mechanisms are missing something you need, please expand them.

For reference, start looking at tcp_get_timestamping_opt_stats() history.

Sender side can for instance get precise timestamps.

Combinations of these timestamps reveal different parts of the overall
network latency,

T0: sendmsg() enters TCP
T1: first byte enters qdisc
T2: first byte sent to the NIC
T3: first byte ACKed in TCP
T4: last byte sent to the NIC
T5: last byte ACKed
T1 - T0: how long the first byte was blocked in the TCP layer ("Head
of Line Blocking" latency).
T2 - T1: how long the first byte was blocked in the Linux traffic
shaping layer (known as QDisc).
T3 - T2: the network =E2=80=98distance=E2=80=99 (propagation delay + curren=
t queuing
delay along the network path and at the receiver).
T5 - T2: how fast the sent chunk was delivered.
Message Size / (T5 - T0): goodput (from application=E2=80=99s perspective)
