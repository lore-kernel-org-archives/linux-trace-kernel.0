Hmm, is there any way to ensure the function is called from task_call_func()?
(Maybe checking p->pi_lock, but this is not sure the lock owner is this
context?) If not, I need to make this available only for current task
(anyway it just return kretprobe trampoline address, no critical issue)
or, introduce a spinlock.

Or, eventually it may be better to replace kretprobe/rethook with
fprobe return handler.

Thank you,
