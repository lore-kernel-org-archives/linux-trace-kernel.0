Given the precedent of memblock_mark_nomap(), as long as the reusable 
reserved-memory regions also get split into distinct memblocks, then it 
seems like in principle we ought to be able to give them a new 
MEMBLOCK_PTEMAP (or whatever) flag which could then be picked up in 
map_mem() without needing to override force_pte_mapping() globally?

Cheers,
Robin.
