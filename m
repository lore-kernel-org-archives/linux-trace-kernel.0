If you cannot explain what the problem is (you haven't), there is
nothing to fix.

Also, current kernels cannot be build without PREEMPT; and if you care
about latency running a PREEMPT=n kernel is daft. That said,
TIF_NEED_RESCHED should work irrespective of PREEMPT settings, the
PREEMPT settings just affect when and how you end up in schedule().

Even without PREEMPT, if there is a task waiting either the wakeup or
the tick will set TIF_NEED_RESCHED and it should stop spinning. If there
is no task waiting, there is no actual latency, just burning CPU time,
and that isn't a problem per-se.

What should happen is that the first spinner gets the lock next, the
next spinner is then promoted to first spinner and so on.

This chain continues, which means the lock owner is always
on-cpu and good progress is being made and there is no CPU contention,
or the spinner gets marked for preemption (as said, this does not
require PREEMPT=y) and will stop spinning and go sleep, or the owner
goes to sleep and all the spinners stop and also go sleep.

Again, you have not said anything specific enough to figure out what
happens on your end. You said the owner changes, this means there is
progress made. What isn't clear is if any one particular spinner is
starved (that would be a problem) or if this latency spike you observe
is worse than would be from running a while(1) loop, in which case,
that's just how it is.

What is not sane, is marking random locks with random properties just
because random workload.
