Feature. The above paragraph is just an intro. Remove it?

That's BPF_F_MMAPABLE, right?

That does not work because the mmapped region is global. Our requirements a=
re:

1. Single tracing BPF program.

2. Per-process (per VM) memory region (here it's per-thread, but each
thread just registers the same process-wide region).  No sharing
between processes.

3. From #2 it follows: exec unregisters the registered memory region;
fork gets a cloned region.

4. Unprivileged processes can do prctl(REGISTER). Some of them might
not be able to use the bpf syscall.

The reason for #2 is that each user space process also writes to the
memory region (read by the BPF program to make updates depending on
what state it finds), and having shared state between processes
doesn't work here.

Is there any reasonable BPF facility that can do this today? (If
BPF_F_MMAPABLE could do it while satisfying requirements 2-4, I'd be a
happy camper.)

bpf_probe_write_user() can, but safety is not built in, along with
getting fork + exec right is brittle.

The main goal is to a) avoid accidental writes into areas the user
space program doesn't want writing to, along with 2) weakly
associating "type" via a tag. As soon as the user space program does
prctl(REGISTER, tag) it wants writes to happen. It's the user space
program's fault if it uses random tags, because in practice, we know
exactly which BPF programs are running in production and which tags
they service. The programs we do _care_ about are reviewed and do use
the right tags. The mechanism is not for protecting BPF programs or
what data they communicate, but for the benefit of the user space
program itself to bound the memory that could be touched in its own
address space (use the wrong region/tag .. tough luck).
