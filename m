Since patch 10 moves the warning out of line, it costs nothing on the
fast path, so making the WARN configurable wouldn't save anything. The
question is really whether the mm check itself should be configurable,
and that check is also what makes the access safe.

The text size increase seems manageable[1], but it would be great to
hear other people's thoughts. For the runtime cost, I'll do some
performance testing. My guess is that a load of current->mm and a
well-predicted branch per user access will be negligible, but I'll get
numbers.

That's a fair point. If user memory were inaccessible in kernel threads
and after exit_mm(), every such access would fault, and the fault
handler could WARN about it (x86's do_user_addr_fault() already has a
!mm branch), so it could still be loud without a check on every access.

I'll look into disabling lazy mm switching on x86 and doing some
performance testing with that (like comparing the per-uaccess check
with the added cost of non-lazy mm switching).

Other than the performance difference, I see these issues with making
uaccess safe entirely with the mm switch mechanics:

 - It only helps on architectures (and configs) that implement it,
   while the common check works everywhere today.

 - The fault handler would need to tell legitimate faults apart from
   bugs, e.g. copy_from_user_nofault() from BPF or perf in a kernel
   thread is fine and must stay quiet. The series handles that today by
   checking current->mm in the nofault helpers (patch 6).

The two approaches are mostly complementary: if non-lazy switching
turns out to be cheap enough, an architecture that does this will have
better defense against uaccess bugs. But I'd still like the common
check so that these bugs are reported on every architecture.

Agreed, I think we should clean those up, but that can be done
separately. This series already adds the check to the common
__copy_{from,to}_user() and __copy_{from,to}_user_inatomic() wrappers
in include/linux/uaccess.h (patches 7 and 8), so the KVM path is
covered without converting the callers first.

Making the same point as Sean[2] but with a little more detail, I had
thought about making the change in access_ok(), but:

 - On x86-64 and powerpc, the masked user access paths don't call
   access_ok() at all. That includes copy_from_user(),
   strncpy_from_user(), strnlen_user() and every scoped_user_*_access()
   block, which is where many of the converted __get_user() users ended
   up.

 - __copy_{from,to}_user() and __copy_from_user_inatomic() skip it too,
   and the KVM bug followed exactly that pattern: the range was checked
   once up front, and the access came much later from a different
   context.

 - access_ok() is also used as a plain range check where having no mm
   is fine. For example, copy_{from,to}_user_nofault() call
   __access_ok()/access_ok(), and BPF and perf legitimately call those
   from kernel threads, so a WARN there would fire on valid tracing.

Even the quiet 'if (!mm) return false' version would have missed the
KVM case, because of the first two points. I don't think there's really
a "small" fix here, unfortunately. :/

Thanks again for all the feedback, Arnd. I really hope we can get this
series into a mergeable state. :)
