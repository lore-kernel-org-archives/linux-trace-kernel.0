>=20

Turns out that the system we need this for is very likely going to end
up using 4 KiB pages anyway because it doesn't have a whole lot of RAM
(which is the whole reason we want the VPR to be resizable in the first
place). So it sounds like set_direct_map_*() is a good way forward.

Still, wouldn't it potentially be much faster to unmap entire 2 MiB
blocks at a time if we know the driver guarantees the alignment? Maybe
the changes to add num_pages as an argument to set_direct_map_*() that
Mike mentioned would already be an improvement because it avoids those
gratuitous calls to can_set_direct_map().
