If such older kernels don't do anything with the section anyway, what's
the point of pretending they do?

Returning an error would actually make more sense as it communicates
that the kernel doesn't support whatever hypothetical thing you're
trying to do with 0 FDEs.

It's simple, we don't add code to "support" some vague hypothetical.

For whatever definition of "support", since there's literally nothing
the kernel can do with that.

Makes sense.  Though I also have another idea below.

Binary search would definitely help.  I did a crude histogram for "FREs
per FDE" for a few binaries on my test system:

gdb (the biggest binary on my test system):

10th Percentile: 1
20th Percentile: 1
30th Percentile: 1
40th Percentile: 3
50th Percentile: 5
60th Percentile: 8
70th Percentile: 11
80th Percentile: 14
90th Percentile: 16
100th Percentile: 472

bash:

10th Percentile: 1
20th Percentile: 1
30th Percentile: 3
40th Percentile: 5
50th Percentile: 7
60th Percentile: 9
70th Percentile: 12
80th Percentile: 16
90th Percentile: 17
100th Percentile: 46

glibc:

10th Percentile: 1
20th Percentile: 1
30th Percentile: 1
40th Percentile: 1
50th Percentile: 4
60th Percentile: 6
70th Percentile: 9
80th Percentile: 14
90th Percentile: 16
100th Percentile: 44

libpython:

10th Percentile: 1
20th Percentile: 3
30th Percentile: 4
40th Percentile: 6
50th Percentile: 8
60th Percentile: 11
70th Percentile: 12
80th Percentile: 16
90th Percentile: 20
100th Percentile: 112

So binary search would help in a lot of cases.

However, if we're going that route, we might want to even consider a
completely revamped data layout.  For example:

One insight is that the vast majority of (cfa, fp, ra) tuples aren't
unique.  They could be deduped by storing the unique tuples in a
standalone 'fre_data' array which is referenced by another
address-specific array.

  struct fre_data {
	s8|s16|s32 cfa, fp, ra;
	u8 info;
  };
  struct fre_data fre_data[num_fre_data];

The storage sizes of cfa/fp/ra can be a constant specified in the global
sframe header.  It's fine all being the same size as it looks like this
array wouldn't typically be more than a few hundred entries anyway.

Then there would be an array of sorted FRE entries which reference the
fre_data[] entries:

  struct fre {
  	s32|s64 start_address;
	u8|u16 fre_data_idx;
	
  } __packed;
  struct fre fres[num_fres];

(For alignment reasons that should probably be two separate arrays, even
though not ideal for cache locality)

Here again the field storage sizes would be specified in the global
sframe header.

Note FDEs aren't even needed here as the unwinder doesn't need to know
when a function begins/ends.  The only info needed by the unwinder is
just the fre_data struct.  So a simple binary search of fres[] is all
that's really needed.

But wait, there's more...

The binary search could be made significantly faster using a small fast
lookup array which is indexed evenly across the text address offset
space, similar to what ORC does:

  u32 fre_chunks[num_chunks];

The text address space (starting at offset 0) can be split into
'num_chunks' chunks of size 'chunk_size'.  The value of
fre_chunks[offset/chunk_size] is an index into the fres[] array.

Taking my gdb binary as an example:

.text is 6417058 bytes, with 146997 total sframe FREs.  Assuming a chunk
size of 1024, fre_chunks[] needs 6417058/1024 = 6267 entries.

For unwinding at text offset 0x400000, the index into fre_chunks[] would
be 0x400000/1024 = 4096.  If fre_chunks[4096] == 96074 and
fre_chunks[4096+1] == 96098, you need only do a binary search of the 24
entries between fres[96074] && fres[96098] rather than searching the
entire 146997 byte array.

.sframe size calculation:

    374 unique fre_data entries (out of 146997 total FREs!)
    = 374 * (2 * 3) = 2244 bytes

    146997 fre entries
    = 146997 * (4 + 2) = 881982 bytes

    .text size 6417058 (chunk_size = 1024, num_chunks=6267)
    = 6267 * 8 = 43869 bytes

Approximate total .sframe size would be 2244 + 881982 + 8192 = 906k,
plus negligible header size.  Which is smaller than the v2 .sframe on my
gdb binary (985k).

With the chunked lookup table, the avg lookup is:

  log2(146997/6267) = ~4.5 iterations

whereas a full binary search would be:

  log2(146997) = 17 iterations

So assuming I got all that math right, it's over 3x faster and the
binary is smaller (or at least should be roughly comparable).

Of course the downside is it's an all new format.  Presumably the linker
would need to do more work than it's currently doing, e.g., find all the
duplicates and set up the data accordingly.
