Indeed. The rethook is making a shadow stack by list, thus caller must
guarantee the target process is blocked at least during this function.

The commit messages suggest that when BPF takes a backtrace, it also
includes other running tasks. Is that safe?

This check has been introduced when it is copied from
kretprobe_find_ret_addr(). It has the comment:

 * The @tsk must be 'current' or a task which is not running. @fp is a hint

IIRC, I added this check to explicitly verify this condition.

Yeah, but is there any way to ensure the task is blocked? Even if it is
blocked, like TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE, unless holding the actual lock in
the rethook, it may not be possible to ensure it?

Of course, we could give up on checking within this function and leave
everything to the caller to guarantee - as kretprobe does.

BTW, the reason why we made it possible to pass tasks other than current
 is that the stack unwinding code itself supported unwinding tasks other
than current, so we had no choice but to create this interface.

However, it is a bad idea to check this in deep inside of unwinding.

Agreed.

OK, thanks for your review!

Tengda, can you send a patch to just remove the check?

Thank you,
