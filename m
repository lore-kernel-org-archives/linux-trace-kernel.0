Ah yeah I kinda lost those but indeed doing this is a good idea.

I should try to dig those out again or look again when I have a chance...

Yes and another point and I think it's one that Kiryl also gets at is - can we
_please_ stop pretending huge folios == THP == what the page cache does == page
special cases like DAX? :)

I think Matthew had ideas (TM) about separating out CONFIG_THP from that stuff
but that's another way in which we can unwend some of the horrors.

Yeah annoyingly it's not all straightforward. I wonder if actually gauging off
of what series often touch in patches might be a good way of figuring out how to
separate, funnily enough (certainly for mm-next conflict resolution purposes
anyway).
