OK, for me, this last sentence is preferred for the help message. That explains
what this is for. 

	  All callbacks that attach to the function tracing have some sort
	  of protection against recursion. This option is only to verify that
	　ftrace (and other users of ftrace_test_recursion_trylock()) are not
	  called outside of RCU, as if they are, it can cause a race.
	  But it also has a noticeable overhead when enabled.

BTW, how much overhead does this introduce? and the race case a kernel crash?
or just messed up the ftrace buffer?
