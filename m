The issue is that there's still cases that we can trace when
preempt_count hasn't been updated to the new context. That is,
preempt_count is used to determine if we are in softirq, hardirq or NMI
context. But there's some places that have:

 normal context:
 func_a() --> traced
   --> interrupt
    func_b() --> traced
    preempt_count_add(HARDIRQ_OFFSET)

Now we drop the second trace because it is flagged as a recursion when
in reality it is in a new context, but the preempt_count has not been
updated yet.

We are currently fixing these locations, but it's not there yet. And
since there's tools that relies on not dropping these locations, the
transition bit needs to be there until this situation is dealt with.

Can you change the tests to allow a single recursion?
