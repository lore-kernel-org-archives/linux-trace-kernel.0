OK, so this is dynamic TrustZone, which is essentially identical to CCA 
delegation as far as we're concerned from the Non-Secure side. IIRC 
there was some ongoing talk about explicitly keeping track of the state 
of physical memory ranges in terms of being delegated to CoCo VMs or 
not, so eventually plumbing a "delegated to TEE/other" state through all 
the same mechanisms seems a pretty achievable goal.

For now, though, firstly I'll note we have seen this sort of thing before:

https://lore.kernel.org/dri-devel/20240515112308.10171-1-yong.wu@mediatek.com/

although that didn't seem to need explicit unmapping (likely it involved 
a TrustZone controller that just made NS accesses RAZ/WI instead of 
external-aborting).

If you want to be nice and start trying to build the general abstraction 
for this, then as a first step I'd suggest following the shape of the 
current CCA machinery - build a "delegate to TEE" operation around the 
existing set_memory_valid() paradigm[1] with can_set_direct_map() 
safeguards, and have something like a have_dynamic_tz() that echoes 
is_realm_world() in terms of being set at boot when one of these regions 
is detected by the early reserved-memory parsing, then considered in 
force_pte_mapping() (such that it only matters if BBML3 doesn't already 
have us covered).

Thanks,
Robin.


[1] Personally I'd be inclined to stay away from set_memory_*crypted() 
until that mess gets sorted out properly, but the argument could also be 
made the other way that the "delegated" state is currently mixed up in 
"encrypted", so technically it wouldn't be entirely inaccurate to use, 
it would just mean that we're intentionally adding more to that cleanup 
effort. For now it seems nicer to me to keep a distinct "made invalid 
(due to delegation)" state that can eventually converge into a proper 
"delegated" state once that exists, rather than get mixed up in the 
current 
guest-shared/guest-private/host-shared/host-private/host-delegated mess 
most of which is not relevant for non-CoCo uses.
