It's not just walking the page tables, it's creating one that nobody else
is using. Since we want to keep all executable code read only, the way
text_poke() works is to create a new memory mapping where the pages it has
isn't visible by anyone else (which is why it doesn't use init_mm). And
then makes a mapping to the executable address as non executable and
writable. Makes the update, and then removes the mapping.

It's all about updating read only pages that are executable with a shadow mm.
