If we don't have __GFP_PRIVATE, then probably not.  This is a holdover
from the current __GFP_PRIVATE branch so that if the preferred_nid=
value is a private node (which is a hint, but not a hard control),
there's a way for that allocation to land *somewhere*.

__GFP_PRIVATE would say "Only allow access to private nodes if this
flag is provided - otherwise treat that as unreachable and fall back".

(__GFP_PRIVATE | __GFP_THISNODE) then does exactly what you expect (only
allocate from specifically this private node and don't fall back).

This has the added benefit of not causing OOM on allocation failure.

Some would consider such a request a bug (i.e. that caller has a bad
mask), but I find the premise of that statement to be flawwed if only
because we do not have good controls over what ends up in a nodemask due
to the existence of things like possible_nodes.

Agreed, but also one which can be deferred and played with since it's
all kernel-internal.  None of this should have UAPI implications, and we
need need to accept that we're going to get it wrong on the first try.

"Baked in" in this case would mean:

  set_mempolicy(..., private_node) -> -EINVAL
  mbind(..., private_node)         -> Success

With appropriate documentation.

This can be changed later if a reasonable design was agreed upon.

Because pagecache pages are associated with potentially many VMAs.

The fault can be a soft fault or a hard fault.  On soft fault - the page
was already present, and will simply fault into VMA without being
migrated.

You can imagine the following

Process A:
    fd = open("somefile", ...);
    mem = mmap(fd, ...);
    mbind(mem, ..., private_node_A);
    for page in mem:
       mem[page_off] /* fault file into private memory */

Process B:
    fd = open("somefile", ...);
    mem = mmap(fd, ...);
    mbind(mem, ..., private_node_B);
    for page in mem:
       mem[page_off] /* fault file into private memory */

If process A runs first, and assuming VMA mempolicy is respected for
file backed allocation (note: it's not, see below) - then the second
process will think the memory now lives on node B when it's already
living on node A (pages are not migrated on fault).

filemap page cache means file-backed pages are global resources.

Re file-backed VMAs - see filemap_alloc_folio_noprof in mm/filemap.c

struct folio *filemap_alloc_folio_noprof(gfp_t gfp, unsigned int order)
{
        int n;
        struct folio *folio;

        if (cpuset_do_page_mem_spread()) {
                unsigned int cpuset_mems_cookie;
                do {
                        cpuset_mems_cookie = read_mems_allowed_begin();
                        n = cpuset_mem_spread_node();
                        folio = __folio_alloc_node_noprof(gfp, order, n);
                } while (!folio && read_mems_allowed_retry(cpuset_mems_cookie));

                return folio;
        }
        return folio_alloc_noprof(gfp, order);
}

We'd have to hang a mempolicy off of the file and use fctl or something
like this if we want a file to have a node preference.

Reclaim support is feasible, but again - crawl, walk, run.

If we get the base private node infrastructure in place, we can break
things like mempolicy and reclaim support into different work streams
to enable support for these features.

Different private node users will be interested in different
combinations of mm/ service support.

For example:  compressed memory as a swap backend DOES NOT want explicit
reclaim support - it will need to manage its own shrinker.  This comes
from requirements associated with that specific use case (which I do not
want to get into here).

That is why this series introduced the concept of NP_OPS_* - so that the
owner (driver) of a private node (such as a CXL-enabled accelerator
driver) can tell mm/ what services it should enable for that node.

This is informed by a single use case / device.

There are users / devices that don't want any UAPI for their memory,
but simply wish to re-utilize some subsection of mm/ (page_alloc,
reclaim, etc).

I am trying to test whether, lacking __GFP_PRIVATE, any normal runtime
operations access private nodes removed from fallback lists are reached
via something like the possible / online nodemask.

I remember, maybe a year ago, there were per-node allocations happening
during hotplug and that's why I originally proposed __GFP_PRIVATE, but
I'm trying to re-collect that data now.
