Subject: [RFC PATCH 47/57] mm/madvise: collapse under a per-VMA read lock

From: "Kiryl Shutsemau (Meta)" <kas@kernel.org>

MADV_COLLAPSE arrives under mmap_lock, gives it up, and takes it again per
PMD to scan and hand a table to the collapse.  Every writer to the address
space waits behind each of those, and the range can be as large as the
caller asked for.

Take a read lock on the VMA instead: MADVISE_VMA_READ_LOCK in the lock
mode, lock_vma_under_rcu() per PMD, and the walk told not to release what
the behaviour already let go.

A scan that finds nothing keeps the lock, so a range that is already
collapsed walks it without relocking.  A collapse gives the lock up and
looks the VMA up again afterwards: it can shrink while nothing is held,
which the scan reports as a refused range like any other.

Remote madvise is the exception.  process_madvise() has to untag the range
with untagged_addr_remote() before any VMA is looked at.  That reads mm
state mmap_lock protects, so remote MADV_COLLAPSE keeps the mmap_read it
has.

A VMA that cannot be locked is reported as SCAN_VMA_LOCK, which reaches
the caller as -EAGAIN.  lock_vma_under_rcu() also fails on a VMA being
written to, and reporting that as a range which shrank would tell the
caller a collapse succeeded where none was attempted.  With that, nothing
produces SCAN_VMA_NULL any more, and the test for it goes.

Both callers hold a read lock on the VMA now.  That is what the changes
outside madvise.c are for: the engine's interface documented mmap_lock as
its precondition, and only here does that stop being true of every caller.
The scan asserts the lock again too, which was not possible while the
callers disagreed.
