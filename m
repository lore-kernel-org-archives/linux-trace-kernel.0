A more concrete example up your alley:

I've since been playing with a virtio-net private node.

Normally cloud-hypervisor VMs with virtio-net can't be subject to KSM
because the entire boot region gets marked shared.  If virtio-net has
its own private node / region separate from the boot region, the boot
region is now free to be subject to KSM.

I may have that up as an example sometime before LSF, but i need to
clean up some networking stack hacks i've made to make it work.

Correct, when you hotplug memory into a node, it's a free for all.
Fallbacks are going to happen.

I see you saw below that one of the extensions is removing the nodes
from the fallback list.  That is part one, but it's insufficient to
prevent complete leakage (someone might iterate over the nodes-possible
list and try migrating memory).

Basically the only isolation mechanism we have today is ZONE_DEVICE.

Either via mbind and friends, or even just the driver itself managing it
directly via alloc_pages_node() and exposing some userland interface.

You can imagine a network driver providing an ioctl for a shared buffer
or a driver exposing a mmap'able file descriptor as the trivial case.

One of the complications of exposing this memory via mbind is that
mempolicy.c has a lot of migration mechanics, just to name two:

  - migrate on mbind
  - cpuset rebinds

So for a completely solution you need to support migration if you
support mempolicy.  But with the callbacks, you can control how/when
migration occurs.

tl;dr: many of mm/'s services are actually predicated on migration
support, so you have to manage that somehow.

in the NP_OPS_MIGRATION patch, this gets covered.

I'm not sure the NP_OPS_* pattern is what we actually want, it's just
what i came up with to make it clear what's being enabled.

Basically without NP_OPS_MIGRATION, this memory is completely
non-migratable.  The driver managing it therefore needs to control the
lifetime, and if hotplug is requested - kill anyone using it (which by
definition should not the kernel) and either release the pages or take
them so they can be released while hotplug is spinning.

I experimented with this.  There were two concerns:

1) as you note, removing it from the default bitmaps, which is actually
   hard.  You can't remove it from the possible-node bitmap, so that
   just seemed non-tractable.

2) __GFP_THISNODE actually means (among other things) "don't fallback".
   And, in fact, there are some hotplug-time allocations that occur in
   SLAB (pglist_data) that target the private node that *must* fallback
   to successfully allocate for successful kernel operation.

So separating PRIVATE from THISNODE and allowing some use of fallback
mechanics resolves some problems here.

I think #2 is a solvable problem, but #1 i don't think can be addressed.
I need to investigate the slab interactions a little more.

Note: I've actually since explored merging this with pgmap, and
rebranding it as node-scope pgmap.

In that sense, you could think of this as NODE_DEVICE instead of
NODE_PRIVATE - but maybe I'm inviting too much baggage :]

Many `folio_is_zone_device()` hooks result in the operations being
a no-op / failing.  We need all those same hooks.

Some hooks I added - such as migration hooks, are combined with the
zone_device hooks via i helper to demonstrate the pattern is the same
when the memory is opted into migration.

I do not think all of these hooks are required, I would think of this
more as an exploration of the whole space, and then we can throw what
does not have an active use case.

For the compressed ram component I've been designing, the needs are:

- Migration
- Reclaim
- Demotion
- Write Protect (maybe, possibly optional)

But you could argue another user might want the same device to have:
- Migration
- Mempolicy

Where they manage things from userland, rather than via reclaim.

The flexibility is kind of the point :]

I would simply state: "That depends on the memory device"

Which is kind of the point.  The ability to isolate and poke holes in
that isolation explictly, while using the same mm/ code, creates a new
design space we haven't had before.

---

I think it would be fair to say all of these would not be required for
an MVP interface, and should require a use case to merge.  But the code
is here because I wanted to explore just how far it can go.

In fact, I believe I have gotten to the point where I could add:

  NP_OPS_FALLBACK_NODE  - re-add the node to the fallback list
                          do not require __GFP_PRIVATE for allocation

Which would require all of the other bits to be turned on.

The result of this is essentially a numa node with otherwise normal
memory, but for which a driver gets callbacks on certain operations
(migration, free, etc).  That ALSO seems useful.

It's... an interesting result of the whole exploration.
