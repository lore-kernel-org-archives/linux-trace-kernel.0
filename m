Agreed. Sorry for replying late.

Yes. Unless doing setup_arch() we can not get initrd image, this means
we don't know whether there is bootconfig or not at that point.

Indeed. So I think this EMBED_CMDLINE is more like CMDLINE set by bootconfig
file, instead of embedded string. That is useful for reusing the boot options.
We need to change the explanation and clarify it.

Thus we should those configs mutual exclusive. If user already sets the
CONFIG_CMDLINE, EMBED_CMDLINE should not be enabled.

But actually, there is another options we need to mention:

- CONFIG_CMDLINE: default cmdline, could be ignored if bootloader passes
   a cmdline string.
- CONFIG_CMDLINE_FORCE: ignore the other cmdline. (but bootconfig can
  overwrite it, hmm)
- CONFIG_CMDLINE_EXTEND: append the embedded cmdline string to bootloader
  cmdline. (similar to bootconfig current behavior)

- CONFIG_BOOT_CONFIG_EMBED: just an embedded bootconfig. extends the
  existing cmdline, but does not support early parameters. This is ignored
  if user passed bootconfig via initrd.

- CONFIG_BOOT_CONFIG_EMBED_CMDLINE: replacing CONFIG_CMDLINE with bootconfig
  but it will not shown in /proc/bootconfig.

So you can see CONFIG_BOOT_CONFIG_EMBED_CMDLINE is a bit special.
I think it maybe natual that we call it CONFIG_CMDLINE_BOOT_CONFIG.
In this case, we render the cmdline string from bootconfig build-time
and set CONFIG_CMDLINE with the rendered cmdline string.

Agreed.

I would like to avoid such complexity, just keep it simple as possible.

Yes, I agree with you.

My recommendation is to give simpler mind model to users. If it is simply
extend the CONFIG_CMDLINE which can be described by bootconfig file,
that is more managable outside of kernel configuration.

Or, you would like to access cmdline setting via /proc/bootconfig?
In this case, the problem is a bit more limitation of bootconfig side.

Since the kernel cmdline accepts any contradictory settings, if "foo=A foo=B"
are passed, bootconfig will make an error because foo has 2 different
settings.
Typically, this is represented as an array in bootconfig.

 foo = A, B;

But if cmdline bootconfig says:

 foo = A;

and initrd bootconfig says:

 foo := B;

":=" means overriding the previous settings. Thus a contradiction
arises between these two, when rendering /proc/bootconfig. It can not
show 2 different settings for the same key. (it is possible if we
render it twice, but /proc/bootconfig user may not expect it.)

I think it's fine to represent it as an array (foo = A, B) if this
ENBED_CMDLINE is set, but it still seems risky if early parameters
aren't detected. If `early_param = A` is set in the embedded
bootconfig, and accidentally initrd bootconfig sets `early_param = B`
we should ignore latter one (with warning). But maybe it is another
story.

I think we can proceed it without rendering it in /proc/bootconfig
at this point. And later we find the way to detect early parameters
correctly, we can fix it.

(BTW, early parameter problem is a bit complicated. It is not hard
to distinguish early parameters, but kernel accepts the same key
for early parameter and normal parameter. e.g. "console=")

Thank you,
