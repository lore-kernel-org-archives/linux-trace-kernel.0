Hi Vincent,

Thanks for sending this!

Hmm, do we really need to shorten it? Why not just call it "hypervisor". I
mean tab completion helps with the typing.

Hmm, I don't think it should be hard to support that. I've been looking
into it for the user mapping. But that can be added later. For now, perhaps
"cat trace" just returns -EPERM?

Hmm, why this?  I haven't looked at the patches yet, but why can't the
write to trace just stop tracing and re-enable it after the reset?
