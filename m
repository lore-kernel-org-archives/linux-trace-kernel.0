Yes, it makes sense.

Thanks for the detailed explanation.

It's already partly done, but it differs by attach type.

The perf-event tracepoint path -- trace_call_bpf(), and the perf-overflow
(PMI) path bpf_overflow_handler() -- share a global per-CPU counter,
bpf_prog_active: while a BPF program is running on a CPU, any further
BPF on that CPU is skipped (the prog_array is re-entered only to bump
the miss counter). So a tracepoint firing inside BPF code does not
recurse there; the handler is dropped. That is already the "disable
TP_BPF while TP_BPF runs" behaviour, analogous to disabling interrupts.

The raw_tracepoint path is different: __bpf_trace_run() uses
bpf_prog_get_recursion_context(), which is per-program -- only the *same*
program is prevented from recursing; *different* programs can nest. So a
raw_tp handler can run nested inside another raw_tp handler on the same
CPU.

So the recursion/disabling mechanism exists, but it isn't uniform: the
perf path is already "disable-like", raw_tp is not. That asymmetry is
itself part of what makes the lockdep picture messy.

On the per-table lock_class_key in rhashtable_params: that sounds right
to me. I'll rework the rhashtable patch so each table can declare its own
key in params -- framed as "different tables live in different lockdep
contexts" (not per-init-site, as in my first attempt) -- and resend.

Two small notes:
 - if the field is a `struct lock_class_key *` pointer, the params struct
   can stay const: lockdep writes to the pointed-to key, not the struct,
   so no cast-away-const is needed;
 - callers that don't set it would fall back to the shared class (current
   behaviour), so it's opt-in and doesn't churn existing users.

On LOCKDEP_STATE(TP_BPF): it reads as the more general fix, but it's a
larger change in the locking core and would need the recursion gate made
uniform across attach types first (raw_tp currently runs despite the
global gate). I'd lean toward starting with the per-table-key change for
the reported false positive and treating the TP_BPF-context modelling as
the longer-term direction -- happy to take guidance from you and the
locking folks on scope.
