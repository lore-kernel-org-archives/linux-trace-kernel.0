I hoped that the keys would be embedded in the params.  That would work
nicely if all users simply used a global params structure.  But a few
copy the structures around (I cannot imaging why, but maybe there is a
good reason).  Copying lockdep keys doesn't work.

(And some use extern references....  I wonder home much performance they
lose because the hash/cmp functions cannot be inlined....)

One thing I didn't like about the original patch is that it seemed to add
a lot of noise to the code, passing keys around in multiple places.
Maybe the cleanest approach would be to embed the keys in the "struct
rhashtable" so each table gets its own key.
Then use lockdep_register_key() in rhashtable_init and use it as needed.

You could even have just one key and use the different subclasses for
the different locks.
 0 for rhashtable.mutex
 1 for rhashtable.lock
 2 for the bit locks

but maybe that is needless complexity.

All of the rest of your email is interesting and useful - thanks.
