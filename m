Can you more precise about your definition of homogeneous here?

Are you saying not all memory on a private node will be homogeneous?
   While possible, I would argue that you should not do this and
   should instead prefer to use multiple nodes - 1 per memory class.

Are you saying not all private nodes will be homogenous?
   I don't see the issue with this.

Possibly.  If we can't guarantee isolation without __GFP_PRIVATE, then
we probably can't merge the baseline without it.

This does not fully describe the problem.

A file can be opened and cached as unmapped page cache, and then mapped
at a later time - at which point the mapped copy would share the filemap
page cache page.

Worse, because it's file-backed, you can have the memory faulted onto
your remote node - reclaimed - and the faulted back in via the process
accessing the file via unmapped operations (read/write), at which point
you've had a silent migration occur.

Basically consider

Process A:
   fd = open("myfile", ..., RO);
   read(fd, ...);  /* mm/filemap.c fills page cache */

Process B:
   fd = open("myfile", ...);
   mem = mmap(fd, ...);
   mbind(mem, ..., private_node);
   for page in mem:
       int tmp = mem[page]; /* fault into vma */

The result of Process A running first is Process B thinks it has faulted
the memory onto private_node, but in reality it's taking soft faults and
just getting the filemap folio mapped in.

If you wanted mbind() support from the start, we would have to limit
applicability to anon memory only.

Shared anon memory is different, as there is a radix tree that deals
with a shared mempolicy state.

N_MEMORY essentially states:
	"This is normal memory touch it however you like"

N_MEMORY_PRIVATE (_MANAGED, w/e) says
	"This is NOT normal memory, there are special rules here"

So, no, lets not mimic N_MEMORY.  This is a "closed by default" design,
while N_MEMORY is an "open by default" design.  This design choice is
explicit to make reasoning about these nodes feasible.

So far i have collected:

- Network accelerators carrying their own memory for message buffers
- GPUs with semi-general-purpose working memory across coherent links
- Acceptionally slow distributed memory that you do not want fallback
  allocations to (so you want to deliberately tier what lands there)
- Compressed memory (just another form of accelerator really) which
  has *special access rules* (i.e. writes need to be controlled)

In most if not all of these cases, the right abstraction to reason about
where memory *should come from* IS a NUMA node.

- the network stack can be taught to check if the target device has a
  node with memory and prefer that node over local memory

- accelerators can be given private nodes to manage memory using
  core mm/ components, without worrying that general kernel operation
  will put unrelated memory on those nodes or do things like migrate
  your pages out from under you (unless your driver/service requested
  that).

the tiering application should be somewhat obvious / trivial.

Really I want to get the minimized set out the door so we can start
breaking this up by feature (reclaim, mempolicy, etc), because trying to
reason about it as a whole is infeasible - and I cannot be the single
arbiter of every use case (I simply do not have sufficient context).

I'm reworking it all as we speak.
