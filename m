Yes, and obviously I agree with that very much!

Right and point (a) is exactly my pushback here.

And it's not always so easy to separate.

Yep.

Yes.

What I'm saying is, essentially, go read the code. Go see how coupled things
are. Go read the functions that require you to keep a giant stack of
state to even know what's going on.

Look at the bug rate, and how subtle the bugs are - essentially - 'behold the
horrors' :)

And rather than being opposed to fundamental reworks (actually - it's the exact
opposite - I think THP needs changing from top-to-bottom):

Based on experience of seeing work done in THP - we are _making it worse_ when
we add features without paying down this debt.

I think it's nuanced, because as part of reworking things (you say this below
too), patterns and approaches can fall out.

And you can naturally lead things towards a sensible rework.

Yeah exactly.

Right yes. There's no harm in _laying the foundations_ for future changes.

In fact a lot of reworks are about doing exactly that - you can often go one of
2 paths:

	a. push the feature in as some tacked-on thing that works but adds
	   complexity/maintainership overhhead/etc. or

	b. Change the architecture to suit the feature you intend.

So my opposition is to a, not b.

Yes.

And to be clear and I am going to say this in my (proper) reply to Kiryl - I do
think moving away from the presumption of PMD collapse is _key_ to a more
general rework.

But it's about how we get there, how the rest of the code looks, what other work
we do around it.

Yes. And it does look like a lot of the early patches are along the right road.

I do plan to do some proper feedback on this series along the lines of figuring
out how we move this forwards.
