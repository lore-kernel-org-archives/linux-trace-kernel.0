Thanks for pivoting to .eh_frame unwinding. This work is highly appreciated=
.

The moment deferred unwinding is implemented, the kernel space
objection (https://lwn.net/Articles/728339/) no longer applies.
Every argument for ORC (and derived formats like SFrame) -- that it
must not crash during crash handling, that it is simple enough to be
bug-free, and that it is fast enough for lockdep -- was formulated
specifically to justify that kernel execution path.

On the userspace side, we are seeing major advances in compact unwinding:

* x86-64 (Alexis Engelke): Implemented a compact-unwind encoder in lld
that encodes 100% of Clang (main) -O3 and 99.9% of GCC 15 -O3
functions in an -fno-exceptions libLLVM.so. This reduces .eh_frame_hdr
+ .eh_frame size by 87% for Clang (1.80 descriptors per FDE) and 71%
for GCC (3.85 descriptors per FDE).
https://conf.gnu-tools-cauldron.org/prg26/talk/review/WV7MVNYXJA8XSMKRVBBV9=
GQJZZ3LW9KT
* AArch64 (Shoaib): Implemented a corresponding compact-unwind encoder
for AArch64, used in Android apps.

Crucially, neither of these approaches generates unwind information in
relocatable files.
Given the massive size reductions achieved by these compact unwind
descriptors, I suspect there won't be a use case or remaining need for
.sframe on either AArch64 or x86-64.
