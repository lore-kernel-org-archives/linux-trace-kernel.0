I had similar questions, so let me share, assuming I even got your question
correct. I think what might help is to note that for synchronize_rcu(), any
transition to and from RCU watching is a full memory barrier. And if I
understand correctly, because SRCU fast is not allowed when RCU is not
watching, the memory ordering Required for RCU correctness is automatically
taken care of because the update side uses synchronize_rcu(). 

That is my understanding. Could you clarify how your question is related to the
single instruction thing? I think if you apply the
classical RCU reasoning where RCU (regular RCU) read-side critical sections
do not have any memory barriers, then you will see the similarity of that
with srcu-fast.
