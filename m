Subject: [RFC PATCH 46/57] mm/khugepaged: scan under a per-VMA read lock

From: "Kiryl Shutsemau (Meta)" <kas@kernel.org>

A pass took mmap_lock for the whole walk: every VMA of the address space
judged, and every table of every VMA scanned, under one lock.  A writer
anywhere in the mm waits for all of it.  And a pass that finds nothing to
collapse -- which is what a pass over an already-collapsed address space
is -- holds the lock for the whole sweep to say so.

Take a read lock on one VMA at a time instead.  lock_next_vma() finds the
next VMA at or after the cursor and locks it, falling back to mmap_lock
only where it cannot.  A scan holds that lock across every table of that
VMA and no longer.

What a round has to be excluded from already takes vma_start_write() on
the VMA it touches, so the exclusion is the same.  What changes is that it
is scoped to the VMA being scanned.

Two things follow from the iterator no longer being carried by mmap_lock.

The cursor moves by hand, because nothing else advances it now: past a VMA
that was walked, past one skipped without being looked at, and past each
table a scan was offered.

And the end of the address space has to be recognised rather than fallen
out of.  scan_complete says whether lock_next_vma() ran out of VMAs: an
error is not the end, and treating it as one would release the slot with
the address space half scanned.

The scan asserted mmap_assert_locked() on the way in.  Its two callers no
longer agree on what they hold -- khugepaged a VMA read lock from here,
MADV_COLLAPSE still mmap_lock -- so there is no single lock to assert, and
the assert goes.
