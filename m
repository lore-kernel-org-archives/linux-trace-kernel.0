Correct. My Ack is based on the current way things are done upstream.
It was just that linux-rt showed the issue, where the code was not as
robust as it should have been. To me this was a correctness issue, not
an issue that had to do with how things are done in linux-rt.

As for the changes in linux-rt, they are not upstream yet. I'll have my
comments on that code when that happens.
