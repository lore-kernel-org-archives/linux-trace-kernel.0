This whole reply seems AI-generated...

You replying only to David twice in this sub-thread which isn't exactly giving
me warm fuzzy feelings about the working-around-me concerns I raised here.

So simple feedback - send a relatively small, no-functional-change series that
improves THP code and lays foundations for future changes. After the merge
window.

Can you explicitly ack this please?
