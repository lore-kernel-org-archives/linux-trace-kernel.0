This isn't something that is DT specific. On the Tegra side, I suspect
we might need this on ACPI platforms eventually, too. And it's not an
ARM specific feature either. Other platforms could use shared carveouts,
too.

How so? memblock is really just used as a way of backing the CMA. How
CMA subdivides it doesn't really matter, right?

Or are you suggesting that if we use an entire PMD as granularity, we
could equally well remove the entire PMD from the linear mapping instead
of doing it page-by-page? I think that'd work really well for at least
VPR, since it is 1 MiB aligned anyway. Using a granularity of 2 MiB is
easily doable.

For anything that doesn't require a single contiguous area to be
protected this might be a bit more challenging since it potentially
wastes a lot of memory. On the other hand, a lot of this is heavily
custom code anyway, so the entire stack could be modified to make
efficient use of this (i.e. userspace could allocate a larger chunk
for a pool of buffers, etc.).

It sounds like the right level of abstraction to me. But I'm not too
familiar with this code, so it'd be good to hear from the MM and/or ARM
maintainers what they think about this.

I think it'd be nice to have separate APIs for this case where we know
the memory region is already page-granular (or, I suppose, PMD granular)
and removing from (or adding back to) the linear mapping is safe. That
way we could avoid the checks for can_set_direct_map() for each page.

It'd also be nice to have a version that can update the protection bits
for a range of pages (would map directly to update_range_prot()) instead
of having to manually iterate over each page in a range.

A good middle-ground might be to have helpers that do the grunt work and
they can then be called from VPR and the shared-dma-pool drivers to have
pages removed from the linear mapping. VPR and similar can then perform
the hardware protection bits on top of that.
