Hi folks,

This is based on rc6, but in case it is easier to take on kvmarm/next
(320840b34af2a), the same series applied there is at [1]. It passes the
same checks: bisectable, sparse clean, npVM and pVM boot.

Patches 1-8 are identical. pkvm-7.3 reworked three of the handlers the
series converts, so 9-11 deviate. Patch 9 also declares
__pkvm_vcpu_sync_state, without which its caller has no generated stub.
Patch 10 converts that handler too, and folds the two
get_host_hyp_vcpus() macros into one function. Patch 11 moves the
kern_hyp_va_host() unwrap out of __get_host_hyp_vcpus() to its callers,
since container_of() casts through void * and drops the address space.

Changes since v2 [2]:
  - Dropped the *_VOID() macro variants. void is spelled as the return
    type in the declaration and the definition, and the handler's
    return-register store dispatches on a per-type table instead. The
    table entry is pasted from the return type, so it has to be a
    single word: __pkvm_create_private_mapping is spelled ulong on
    both sides of the boundary. (Marc)

The SMCCC conversion of the host/hyp interface reduced every hypercall
to a function number and a pile of registers: kvm_call_hyp_nvhe() never
shows the compiler a callable, so the caller's arguments and the
handler's DECLARE_REG() casts can disagree in type, count or order
without a diagnostic. Reviewing a fix for exactly that class of bug,
Marc wrote [3]:

  "we lost all form of type-checking when everything was hastily
   converted to SMCCC to avoid function pointers. Somehow, I feel that
   the cure was worse than the disease.

   I wish we'd reintroduce some form of compile-time checks, maybe by
   having generated stubs?"

and sketched the shape he preferred [4]: a generated nvhe_hvc_##f()
stub that does the type-checking, driven by "some form of declarative
IDL", with "both the caller and callee stubs ... totally generated".

This series implements that, in plain preprocessor macros rather
than an external generator, in the mold of the syscall wrappers.
Each hypercall's signature is declared once, in kvm_hcall.h:
kvm_call_hyp_nvhe() resolves to a typed nvhe_hvc_##f() stub
generated from the declaration, and the hyp-main.c handlers
unmarshal their arguments through glue that is type-checked
against the same declaration. A mistyped or stale call, or a
handler that drifts from its caller, now fails to compile. On top
of that shared declaration, host-VA parameters gain a __kern
sparse address space, so dereferencing one at EL2 without
kern_hyp_va_host() translation is flagged by sparse. The address
space is KVM-private and lives with the interface it annotates
rather than in compiler_types.h, like x86's __seg_gs in asm/percpu.h.
The deeper instances of that bug class, host VAs reached through
struct fields after the boundary, are follow-up work.

The declarations do not also generate the function-number enum or the
dispatch table. The enum carries the availability-band markers that
decide when each hypercall becomes reachable, and its base entry is
consumed from assembly, so generating it would hide the banding. The
remaining duplication cannot drift silently: a name mismatch between
declaration, caller and handler fails to compile, and a missing
dispatch-table entry is rejected at run time as
SMCCC_RET_NOT_SUPPORTED.

Along the way it turned out "make C=2" has never checked the nVHE
objects at all: the custom %.nvhe.o rule reuses rule_cc_o_c, which
only hooks the checker for C=1, and that only on a rebuild. Patches
2-5 fix the hook and the handful of pre-existing sparse warnings it
flushes out, so the checker lands clean. The libfdt objects under
arch/arm64/kernel/pi/ have the same gap through the same rule, so
patch 6 gives them the same one-line fix; it touches arm64 core
rather than KVM, so it can go through either tree. Patch 1 is
adjacent: trace_remote_event.h is not self-contained (it uses bool
without including linux/types.h), which the nVHE include order had
been silently working around; it can go through the tracing tree
instead if preferred.

The first six patches do not depend on the type-checking work (the
tracing-header fix, the sparse cleanups, and the two C=2 hook fixes),
so they could be taken on their own, ahead of the rest of the series
if that is easier.

The series is structured as follows:

  01:     Make trace_remote_event.h self-contained.
  02-04:  Fix the pre-existing sparse warnings in the nVHE code.
  05:     Run the source checker on nVHE objects under C=2.
  06:     Same for the libfdt objects under arch/arm64/kernel/pi/.
  07:     Pass the host-VA hypercall arguments as pointers at EL2.
  08:     Move the dispatch macros to a new kvm_hcall.h.
  09:     Declare the hypercall signatures, type-check the callers.
  10:     Generate the handler unmarshalling, type-check the handlers.
  11:     Tag host-VA parameters __kern for sparse.

The generated code is unchanged, checked by comparing the disassembly
of every KVM object, function by function, against the base: the
callers are identical apart from hypercall returns now being tested at
their declared width and the stage-2 TLB-flush level argument now
being sign-extended as it is loaded (an s8 passed as an int), and the
handlers are instruction-for-instruction identical apart from
flush_hyp_vcpu()/sync_hyp_vcpu() being inlined into their only
caller. The extra argument that prompted the thread, a
mistyped or reordered argument, and a handler that disagrees with its
declaration all now fail to compile. checkpatch complains about the
__KVM_HCALL_MAP() machinery, the (type, name) pair syntax and the
generated signature typedefs, as it does about __MAP() in the syscall
wrappers; the idiom cannot be parenthesized, and the typedef is what
checks the handler against the declaration. Enforcing the
__kern tag needs sparse v0.6.5-rc1 or later for __typeof_unqual__,
as all sparse checking on current kernels does; no stable sparse
release has it yet, so build from sparse.git (checker-valid.sh skips
the check, with a warning, on anything older).

Based on Linux 7.2-rc6 (075b74841bd00).

Cheers,
/fuad
