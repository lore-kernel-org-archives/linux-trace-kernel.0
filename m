dma-fence: Support unload for ops->get_XXX_name()

This commit replaces the RCU-protected return values of
dma_fence_driver_name() and dma_fence_timeline_name() with callers
passing destination buffers that are populated under the fence lock.

[Severity: Low]
In C11/gnu11, a const-qualified variable is not an integer constant
expression, so does declaring timeline[len] and driver[len] create stack
VLAs that trigger compiler warnings (and build failures with CONFIG_WERROR
or CONFIG_DRM_I915_WERROR) under -Wvla-larger-than=3D1 in
scripts/Makefile.warn?

The same pattern appears in dma_fence_describe(), intel_gt_watchdog_work(),
i915_request_show(), and timer_i915_sw_fence_wake(). Also, in
dma_fence_release(), these buffers were moved out of the unlikely error
block to the top of the function.

[Severity: High]
What happens in dma_fence_describe() when dma_fence_is_signaled(fence)
returns true?

Previously, timeline, driver, and signaled were initialized to "" at
declaration. Now they are only assigned inside the
if (!dma_fence_is_signaled(fence)) block. When the fence is already
signaled, won't seq_printf() dereference the uninitialized stack pointer
signaled and read the uninitialized stack arrays timeline and driver?

Also, if the fence signals concurrently right after
!dma_fence_is_signaled(fence) evaluates to true,
dma_fence_timeline_name() and dma_fence_driver_name() will populate
"signaled-timeline" and "detached-driver" while signaled is set to "un".

[Severity: Critical]
Is it safe for dma_fence_driver_name() and dma_fence_timeline_name() to
unconditionally acquire dma_fence_lock_irqsave(fence, flags) before
checking if the fence is already signaled?

As noted in the kernel-doc comment above these functions, external memory
not embedded in struct dma_fence (including fence->extern_lock) must not
be accessed after the fence has signaled because drivers are allowed to
free the structure containing the lock once the fence is signaled:

  drivers/gpu/drm/panthor/panthor_sched.c:group_free_queue()
    dma_fence_put(queue->fence_ctx.last_fence);
    kfree(queue); /* frees queue->fence_ctx.lock */

  drivers/gpu/drm/msm/msm_fence.c:msm_fence_context_free()
    kfree(fctx); /* frees fctx->spinlock */

  drivers/gpu/drm/xe/xe_hw_fence.c:xe_hw_fence_irq_finish()
    synchronize_rcu(); /* before freeing irq containing irq->lock */

If a signaled fence is still held (for example in a sync_file) after the
driver frees the structure containing fence->extern_lock, and userspace
calls SYNC_IOC_FILE_INFO -> sync_fill_fence_info() ->
dma_fence_timeline_name(), won't dma_fence_lock_irqsave() dereference and
modify the freed spinlock?

[Severity: High]
Can acquiring dma_fence_lock_irqsave() inside dma_fence_driver_name() and
dma_fence_timeline_name() also cause a recursive spinlock deadlock when
trace_dma_fence_destroy is enabled?

In dma_fence_release(), trace_dma_fence_destroy(fence) is invoked when the
refcount drops to zero, which calls dma_fence_driver_name() and
dma_fence_timeline_name() in TP_fast_assign():

  dma_fence_put(fence)
    -> dma_fence_release()
      -> trace_dma_fence_destroy(fence)
        -> dma_fence_driver_name()
          -> dma_fence_lock_irqsave(fence, flags)

However, several paths in the kernel call dma_fence_put() while already
holding the fence's spinlock:

1. dma_fence_signal_timestamp_locked() holds dma_fence_spinlock(fence)
   while invoking callbacks such as dma_fence_chain_cb(), which calls
   dma_fence_put(f).

2. Drivers with shared external fence locks call dma_fence_put() while
   holding that lock, such as virtio_gpu_fence_event_process() (holding
   drv->lock), nouveau_fence_signal() (holding fctx->lock), and
   hw_fence_irq_run_cb() (holding irq->lock).

If the last reference is dropped on any of these paths while the
dma_fence_destroy tracepoint is active, won't dma_fence_lock_irqsave()
deadlock trying to acquire the already-held lock on the same CPU?

[Severity: Low]
Also, should the kernel-doc comments for dma_fence_driver_name() and
dma_fence_timeline_name() in drivers/dma-buf/dma-fence.c be updated to
document the new @s and @len parameters and void return, as well as the
get_driver_name and get_timeline_name comments in struct dma_fence_ops in
include/linux/dma-fence.h (which still state that the returned string is
RCU protected) and the leftover rcu_read_lock() wrappers around
trace_dma_fence_wait_start() and trace_dma_fence_wait_end() in
dma_fence_wait_timeout()?

[Severity: Low]
In sync_fill_fence_info(), now that dma_fence_timeline_name() and
dma_fence_driver_name() have been moved outside the RCU critical section,
is the remaining rcu_read_lock() / rcu_read_unlock() pair around
dma_fence_get_status() and dma_fence_is_signaled() still needed?

[Severity: High]
Does calling dma_fence_timeline_name() in i915_request_show() introduce a
lock ordering inversion between rq->lock and sched_engine->lock (or
ce->guc_state.lock)?

Each i915_request initializes rq->fence with &rq->lock. During request
signaling in i915_request_retire() and signal_irq_work(), rq->lock is held
while invoking fence callbacks:

  i915_request_retire() / signal_irq_work() [holds rq->lock]
    -> dma_fence_signal_locked(&rq->fence)
      -> dma_i915_sw_fence_wake()
        -> submit_notify()
          -> execlists_submit_request() [acquires sched_engine->lock]
          -> guc_submit_request() [acquires ce->guc_state.lock]

However, i915_request_show() is called while holding sched_engine->lock or
ce->guc_state.lock in paths such as:

  intel_execlists_show_requests() / intel_execlists_dump_active_requests() =
[holds sched_engine->lock]
    -> i915_request_show()
      -> dma_fence_timeline_name() [acquires rq->lock]

  intel_guc_dump_active_requests() [holds ce->guc_state.lock]
    -> intel_engine_dump_active_requests()
      -> engine_dump_request()
        -> i915_request_show()
          -> dma_fence_timeline_name() [acquires rq->lock]

Can this cause an AB-BA deadlock when engine state is dumped concurrently
with request retirement or breadcrumb signaling?

As noted above in dma_fence_driver_name(), calling dma_fence_driver_name()
and dma_fence_timeline_name() inside TP_fast_assign() acquires the fence
spinlock during trace_dma_fence_destroy(fence), which can deadlock when
dma_fence_put() is called under the fence lock.
