Well, you get to keep the pieces. At this point safe only pertains to
'doesn't-crash', all correctness is out the window.

I always forget the crazy BPF does ;-)

Right, but it is a prescriptive comment, not an explanatory one. That
is, it doesn't explain the condition.

This, you cannot take locks in unwinding. The only thing you can do is
try to do the best you can without crashing.

Typically unwind only happens on self -- this is natural, a task crashes
and unwinds itself, or a task does something (takes a lock, hits a
tracepoint, etc) and takes a snapshot of its own stack, and this is
safe.

Things like live-patch use task_call_func(), which ensures the callback
function is done while holding sufficient locks for the task to not
change state.
